# Email Sentiment Analysis

In this example, we will connect a spout called  to an email account using IMAP.
That spout's repo will be the input to a pipeline which will score the emails by sentiment, 
sorting them into two repositories, 
positive and negative.

## Setup

This guide assumes that you already have a Pachyderm cluster running and have configured `pachctl` to talk to the cluster. [Installation instructions can be found here](http://pachyderm.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/local_installation.html).
