# Non-Default Namespaces

Often, production deploys of Pachyderm involve deploying Pachyderm to a non-default namespace. This helps administrators of the cluster more easily manage Pachyderm components alongside other things that might be running inside of Kubernetes (DataDog, TensorFlow Serving, etc.).

To deploy Pachyderm to a non-default namespace, you just need to create that namespace with `kubectl` and then add the `--namespace` flag to your deploy command:

```
$ kubectl create namespace pachyderm
$ pachctl deploy <args> --namespace pachyderm
```

After the Pachyderm pods are up and running, you should see something similar to:

```
$ kubectl get pods --namespace pachyderm
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dash-68578d4bb4-mmtbj    2/2       Running   0          3m
etcd-69fcfb5fcf-dgc8j    1/1       Running   0          3m
pachd-784bdf7cd7-7dzxr   1/1       Running   0          3m
```

**Note** - When using a non-default namespace for Pachyderm, you will have to use the `--namespace` flag for various other `pachctl` command for them to work as expected. This includes undeploy:

```
# undeploying Pachyderm when it was deployed to a non-default namespace
$ pachctl undeploy --namespace pachyderm 
```

Alternatively or additionally, you might want to set a context similar to the following at the Kubernetes level, such that you can get Pachyderm logs, pod statuses, etc. easily via `kubectl logs ...`, `kubectl get pods`, etc.:

```
$ kubectl config set-context pach --namespace=<pachyderm namespace> \
  --cluster=<cluster> \
  --user=<user>
```
