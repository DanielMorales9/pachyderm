# Connecting to your Pachyderm Cluster


## Directly Via PACHD_ADDRESS

This is recommended if you're using the Pachyderm Dashboard for any real amount of time, if you're doing big uploads, or if you're using a Pachyderm client to connect to the cluster.

### Pachd

To expose the pachd service, you need to change the k8s service:

```
$ kubectl edit svc/pachd
```

Then mark the `type` as `LoadBalancer`

If you've gone to the trouble of [deploying within an existing VPC](./existing_vpc), you probably want to limit access to the cluster to IPs originating from this VPC.

In this case, you want an internal load balancer. To expose the pachd service (for `pachctl` access), you'll need to also add the annotation:

```
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: '0.0.0.0/0'
```

Once the load balancer is provisioned, you'll see the address that was provisioned via `kubectl get svc/pachd -o yaml`

E.g. `internal-afsdfasdlkfjh34lkjh-3485763487.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com:650`

You can test that it's working by doing:

```
$ PACHD_ADDRESS=internal-afsdfasdlkfjh34lkjh-3485763487.us-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com:650 pachctl version
COMPONENT           VERSION                                          
pachctl             1.7.3  
pachd               1.7.3
```

You'll want to set this environment variable so that `pachctl` (or your own client) will use it by default. You'll probably want to add it to your bash profile.

### Dash

Similar to exposing the pachd service above, you'll want to make the same modifications to the dash service:

```
$ kubectl edit svc/dash
```

The one additional configuration you'll need to add is the following annotation:

```
service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-connection-idle-timeout: "3600"
```

(This is to allow the long lived websockets that the dash uses to stay alive through the load balancer)
